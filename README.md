 # TinyApp Project

 ## Goal
 - A 3-day tiny (pun intended) web app project using Node.js and Express framework. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs.
 - A simulation of websites such as TinyURL.com, bit.ly, and the like.
 - Note that my focus is on Node and Express, not CSS layout at this point. 

## Technology Stack Used
- Javascript ES6
- `Node`
- `Express.js` 
- `git` for version control
- `cookie-session` for session storage
- `bcrypt` for password encryption

## How to Use 
- To launch this App, run node in terminal/bash/command line
```cl 
node express_server.js
```
- Browse to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Main Features
1. ### Shorten long URLs
    - Simply turn long URL into short URL
1. ### Edit long URLs
    - You can edit long URLs once created
1. ### Share short URLs that are created
    - Simply copy the short URL and share
1. ### Delete the URLs you have created

The new URL will be added to your account. You will be able to see your URLs once logged in. The URLs shown are specific to which you have created. However, you are still able to use other's short URL if you have the URL.
